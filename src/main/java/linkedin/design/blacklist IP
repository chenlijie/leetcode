1. Do we want to design a system which detect malicious Ip address and add them to
blacklist, so we block them.
Or we want to provide a system to customers so they can maintain their blacklist.

If it's first case, we need collect visiting information and have some rules,
then determine whether the IP is malicious or not.

what kind of rules do we define, if the IP visits application thousands times
per second ?

do we need design the tool which collects visiting information ?


1. Prevent other host visit one server.
let's say we have one application, we don't want it visited by some other hosts.

2. we need maintain the relationship between this app and other hosts.

3. what's user volume ?

4. Do we

App
- App Id
- URL

BlackList
- App Id
- Host Address


只需要设计block的service，假设已经有办法获得一个blacklist的列表。
主要debate在于这个service部署在哪里，
一般来说blacklist会是reverse proxy/load balancer的一部分，
不过interviewer认为这个service应该独立出来做一个单独的service，run在一个有cache的box上
